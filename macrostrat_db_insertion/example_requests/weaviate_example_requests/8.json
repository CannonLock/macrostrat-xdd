The average value of two measurements of siltstones, the rock type which hosts the uranium mineralization at Dornod, is 2.575 g/cc, which is less than a 1% variance from the historical reported value. Scott Wilson RPA has retained the old value of 2.60 g/cc and used it in the current resource update."
