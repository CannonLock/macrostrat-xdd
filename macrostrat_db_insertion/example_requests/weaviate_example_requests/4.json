Locally, granite dykes and lenses were intersected. The granite is coarse-grained and porphyritic. Quartz veining tends to increase in intensity in an immediately around the granite due to its more competent nature.\nGold mineralization in generally localized with quartz veining and sulphides with high-grade mineralization typically localized in and around the narrow granodiorite dykes and lenses. The dominant sulphides reported from drilling were pyrite with variable and more local arsenopyrite. The arsenopyrite is generally very finely disseminated. Several occurrences of visible gold in quartz veins are noted on the drill logs (MO95-5 at 28.5 metres, MO95-6 at 37.2 metres and 50.0 metres)."
