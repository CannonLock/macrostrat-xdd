This was defined by logging the point in each drill hole below which all the sulphides are fresh and above which most of the sulphides have been converted to rusty limonite. In most holes this is seen as a very sharp, well-defined line.\nThe sulphides (Py) above the interface have been mostly converted to oxides. In the SW zone, the oxidation process has been more limited, compared to the NE zones. In few holes scattered sulphides remain within the oxide section. These sections are generally short and irregular with little continuity."
