Boston-Skead Gold Belt, Larder Lake Mining Division, Ontario (Modified After Ayer and Trowell, 2000).\nThe Link-Catherine Claims and near-by properties such as the Central Catherine and 80-Foot Falls Claims have historically been explored primarily for their potential to yield major vein-type gold deposits. This has been based upon the numerous auriferous quartz-carbonate veins intersected by past drilling and trenching. By-product levels of silver (Ag) and tellurium (Te) may also be associated with the gold mineralization but this has not yet been documented. There is also permissive and/or documented potential for at least four other types of mineralization; these include major and/or byproduct levels of Te, Cu, Li, Mo, and possibly Rare Earth Elements (REE). All five of the potential deposit types for which the Link-Catherine Property area is prospective are listed below."
